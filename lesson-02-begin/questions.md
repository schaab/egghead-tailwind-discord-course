# Questions for Further Investigation

* Styling elements, how do you reason about spacing? Who is in change of determining it? Is it the element itself? The parent? Who cares as long as it works?
* Flexbox, what are the best practices here? I have a big gap so likely some more reading is required. I had a natural tendency to wrap elements in a `div` or something rather than allowing `flex-box` to _flex_ on the element?
* Sizing...fixed vs not fixed. When do you specify vs not? In this lesson we let the panel headers implicitly determine the size and stuck with that. More gaps to dig into.
